# snips.sh-notification-bot
Send notifications when a new snip is posted.

Todo:
- [ ] Use API to query snips
- [ ] Keep history of posted snips, to avoid duplication (local sqlite? only needs to be small)
- [ ] Ensure age limit, to avoid new bots posting snips from a year ago
- [ ] Notification channels: email, webhook, discord, slack, webex, teams (is there a library for this already?)
